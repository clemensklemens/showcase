This was the final project of my course in machine learning. Goal was to predict if blood cells are infected with malaria or not, based on microscope images. The data was from kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria<br>
Please note because the course was in English the comments and descriptions in the Jupyter-Notebook are also in English
