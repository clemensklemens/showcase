This project will have a look at air pollution data gathered from measuring stations around Switzerland. The dataset is provided by the BFAU. Identifier code of the set is UBD0028@bundesamt-fur-umwelt-bafu. Original dataset is provided in .ods format. The metadata and the explanation of the data fields was dropped and only the dataset itself was kept and converted into a Pandas readable .csv format. The .ods file is also provided.  This project is merely done to gather experience with Pandas on real world data.
